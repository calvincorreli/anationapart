# Core values

* All laws, regulations, institutions, and political decisions should be in the interest of increasing life for all. 
  We should be asking ourselves "what is the decision, design, or structure that will create the most aliveness, love, 
  and happiness for all?"

* We look at the world as a game of creativity, not competition. Life is not a zero-sum game, not without our nation,
  nor in our interaction with other nations. By being creative, innovative, courageous, we can provide tremendous value
  for everyone. The internet and GPS are both examples of amazing tools that was created by the US, specifically the
  DoD, and given to the world, for the benefit of everyone, while clearly giving the US particular benefits through 
  having been the pioneers.

* Each individual mind will always be biased and limited. In order to come up with the best possible solutions, we need 
  diversity of intelligence, insight, and viewpoints, and a process for synthesizing them and getting agreement. 
  This process is called liberal science, and it requires freedom of thought and freedom of speech.
  
* All decisions, as much as possible, should be transparent, not secret. If the success of a strategy hinges on its secrecy
  that's a very good indicator that it's not the best strategy. I reckon that there can be cases where secrecy can be
  warranted, but almost everywhere in politics it's been taken way too far, by orders of magnitude.

* Our land does not belong to us. We're merely the stewards of it, for a time being. Our job is not to exploit it, 
  but to appreciate it, honor it, enjoy it and its riches, and nurture it for generations to come. It's a partnership, 
  not a one-sided exploitation.

* Every citizen has a right to be here, have a right to think and believe what they want, and have a right to express 
  themselves. Any political system that excludes certain groups of citizens cannot be a solution. Note that we're only 
  talking legal citizens here. 

* The nation has a right to decide who else the allow into the country, under what circumstances, and who it will grant 
  citizenship to.
