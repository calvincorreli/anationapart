What do we want people in our country to know and understand?

* Don't believe your thoughts, inquire into them
* Feel your feelings, don't stuff them down
* Listen to and use your intuition
* Creativity: what it really is, how to use it and stoke it
* Health: Movement, basic healthy bodily functions, tension, breathing, posture. Let's show the kids a variety of ways to get movement into your life: yoga, running, team sports, swimming, etc. Then let them choose what inspires them. Also, let's celebrate the body! Such an incredible thing!
* Nutrition: What food is, what it does for your body, what's natural, what's healthy. Also, let's celebrate food!
* Global truths: There's nothing you have to become or achieve to be okay. You cannot control the results. You are already whole and complete. You can be happy in this moment if you investigate your thinking. Things like that.
* Basic coaching tools: What do you want? How do you know what you want? Why do you want it? What beliefs and obstacles are in your way? What else could we do? Fixed vs growth mindsets.
* Bringing love and Inviting spirit into your life. Is this too much?
* Self-awareness. Apart from learning about thoughts and feelings, let's also look at a bunch of different personality tests/frameworks, such as MBTI, DISC, Enneagram, Wealth Dynamics, Human Design, scientific hand analysis, and more. The idea is not that they're necessaily the truth, the idea is to give the kids lots of pointers and inspiration and references, so they can feel what resonates with them, what they feel is true for them. To put the spotlight on each child's uniqueness.
* Unity: Let's also help kids see how we're all similar, and how we're all connected and interdependent
* Masculine/feminine energies
* Drama triangle and being a creator
* Sex ed, but actually useful
* Let them choose based on and follow their own desires and interests to a large extent. Let's show them that it's important to follow your own curiosity.
* Learn how to stimulate your brain and keep it sharp.
* Music, painting, sculpture, potry, and other art forms
* Math
* Language: The national language + at least one foreign language
* Programming: I think it's important for everyone to understand basic programming. It's about a structured way of thinking that's very helpful for understanding and problem solving.
* Physics
* Chemistry
* Design thinking
* History: Important to understand where we come from, and why, and how we fit into a global community
* Democracy and politics: Understanding your role and your power
* Life purpose: Career, role in life. What are you here to do? What excites you? Where do you provide the most value with no effort and the most joy? Let's figure out how to make a career for you here.

These should be taught in elementary school, but also be open to grownups as an evening school or online school. Freely available to all.

It's important that each individual member of society function at their best, so they can be the most happy, healthy, and productive. That lowers costs, and maximizes productive output and also tax revenue. It's good for the country as a whole!
