# # Democracy

The least worst way to govern a country is through indirect democracy: The population elects pubilc servants who make all the day-to-day decisions.

The problem with direct democracy is that it requires the population to spend too much time understanding all the details and nuances of legislation, and there's a high likelihood that people will vote on legislation that's not internally consistent.

The problem with non-democracy is that the temptation for the leaders to abuse their power is too great.

## Elections

One person one vote. 

Voting technology is great, but needs to be secure. All software and hardware components must be open source, and the machines must output a paper ballot that can be verified by the voter before being handed over. Also, let's make sure they're easy to use and beautiful.

It might be possible to build something on the blockchain, but at this point, I'm not confident enough in the unhackability of that system that I'd be willing to base an election off of it.


## Campaigns & Financing

Would love to see if we can limit campaigns to about 1 month, and definitely want to limit campaign financing.

We want a democracy where maney cannot buy influence, as much as possible.


## Governing process and decision making

Political parties are a problem because party discipline makes the system inflexible and limits arguments.

We need a plethora of opinions, and we need people who will argue their actual position, not the party's position. We want to be able to dig deeper into why people think of feel a certain way.

All humans are fallible and have blind spots. But putting our individual minds together, we can arrive at better solutions. Think of the governing process as collaborative problem solving, as co-creation.

We need to do away with any traditional left/right spectrum, it's not helpful. Individuals and opinions and belief systems are much more complex.

Let's learn from newer systems of governing, such as Frome in the UK where 17 council members will explore options together, and will use physical space to step into the "shoes" of people with opposite viewpoints to understand where they're coming from.

We need all the human creativity and ingenuity we can get.

One idea is to build into the system that any decision must be accompanied by exactly what outcome you're aiming for, and tying that back to specific values as to why that's a good thing. Then before any legislation is enacted, we need to validate based on evidence from either our own past, other countries, or smaller experiments conducted specifically for this purpose, whether this is likely to be the outcome, and whether there are unintended side-effects. That way, everything has to be explicit, and we will avoid costly mistakes as much as possible.
