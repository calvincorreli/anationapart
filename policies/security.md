# Security

The nation obviously needs to ensure for the security of its citizens, but let's think a bit more broadly about that.

What does security mean? Does it mean the absense of violent attacks within the nation's borders? Does it mean ensuring 
we don't die or get sick? It's important we define what we mean.

We know with a reasonable degree of certainty that we'll all die eventually, so completely preventing death is not an option. 
We can of course try to ensure that we only die from the things we want to die from, the so-called natural causes.

But quality of life should also be a factor. What's the point of living for many years if we're feeling scared or stressed 
the whole time? I believe it's more important to live an "alive" life than a long life. I also believe that focusing on living
an alive life leads to a longer life, statistically.

I think the number one gift of terrorism is learning how to deal with fear. When you look into your fear, what you realize is 
that you're always okay in this moment, even if you're in pain or lost a limb. If you're dead, you're obviously okay. The only 
suffering comes from thinking about what might happen in the future. And that's exactly what terrorism is designed to exploit. 
The number of people that died in 9/11 is miniscule compared to how many people die in traffic or in gun violence or pretty 
much any other metric you can think of. The less of property is miniscule compared to the subsequent self-inflicted cost 
of overseas wars, invasion of privacy, and all of the ineffective counterterrorism measures implemented since.

If we stop being scared of terrorism, it loses its effect, and eventually it'll stop. It's only effective as long as we're 
being scared by it. Terrorism is not about the people who are killed, it's about the people who stay alive.

Let's have public education centers all over the place that teaches people how to go through fear. It's just an unexamined 
story about the future. Once you examine it, it loses its power. It's as simple as that.
