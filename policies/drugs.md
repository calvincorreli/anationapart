# Drugs and other controlled substances

* Medicine
* Nutritional supplements
* Alcohol
* Tobacco
* Marijuana
* LSD/ayuhuasca/DMT et al
* MDMA/Ecstacy et al
* Cocaine
* Heroin
* etc.

The reality is that when you try to ban any of these substances, you're just feeding a huge criminal empire, you make criminals and prostitutes out of ordinary citizens, and you don't actually stop people from using anyway.

So let's not do that.

Let's make it legal, but provide infrastructure, education, and treatment around it, to mitigate the downside. If people want to take drugs, it's their choice. We'll do our best to ensure they can do it safely, and that they don't get addicted.

## Addiction

It's not the drugs that are addictive. It's the people. We all have addicitons of some sorts. Addictions to work, sex, porn, TV, games, gambling, eating, drinking, smoking, aggression, coffee, tea, foamed milk, nail biting, sugar, carbs, whatever. Take away one addiction, and another one will take its place unless you address the underlying pattern of addiction.

Addiction is about trying to cover up a pain or an emptiness inside with some outside remedy. It will never work, and at the same time you get habituated to your "remedy" of choice so it has less and less of an effect, and therefore you will need more and more of the remedy over time, until you overdose or crash. Then maybe you go to rehab, get weaned off of it, but unless the underlying emptiness or pain gets address, you will relapse.

Stopping an addiction is as easy as one-two-three:

1. Stop the behavior
2. Deal with the emotions that come up
3. There's on step three

The pain or emptiness can be addressed. It can only be addressed, however, by feeling the feelings that need to be felt. Let's teach people to do that, right from kindergartens and elementary schools.
