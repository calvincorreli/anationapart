# Governance

Governance is, to us at least, the process of arriving at decisions in a governing body, whether local, regional, national, or international.

Each city council or parliament or senate or other governing body needs some process for arriving at decisions.

Most bodies are currently based on a party system, whether it's one party, two parties, or a multitude of parties. Unfortunately, there's a lot of problems with political parties when it comes to effective governing.

## Objectives

A governance process needs to accomplish the following:

1. Be constructive and creative, arriving at sound and effective decisions
2. Arrive at a decision in a reasonable amount of time
3. Make sure all voices are heard and use the collective insight, intelligence, and creativity of the members

## Models

There are many processes that do accomplish these objectivse, many of which are detailed here in our pattern section.

However, the pervasive party-political system is not one of them. It fails on all three counts: Discussions go on endlessly, many decisions are disliked by all sides, and the party discipline where the party speaks with one voice prevents dissident voices from being heard, and prevents us from benefiting from the insights, intelligence, and creativity of many or even most of the members.
