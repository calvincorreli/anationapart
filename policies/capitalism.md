# Capitalism

I believe capitalism is an incredible system for allocating resources. We just need to get it right.

Some things the market does best, and we want to step out of the way and allow the market to do its thing as much as possible.

But some things the market does really poorly, and we need to create structures around that.

## Monopolies and cabals

We need competition to be free. Any player with undue influence needs to be stopped. This isn't just about raising prices, it's about abusing a market position to block other players.

We want to reap the rewards of human creativity as much as possible. Monopolies and cabals prevent this from happening.

Let's look at the history of anticompetitive behavior and figure out what the trends are. What kinds of behavior do we want to prevent?

In the age of technology, the tendency towards natural monopolies seem to be greater, and we need to figure out what to do about that. One solution is that the government runs certain services as open source and/or infrastructure projects, but if we do that, we have to ensure that they're actually on par with anything the private sector could've created. We need to figure out how to attract the best, most creative minds to the effort.

## Externalities

When products or services or the manufacture of products or services have costly side-effects, these need to be factored into the cost and funneled back to the company. Or they need to be prevented in the first place.

One obvious example is pollution, but another important one is cyber security, like internet enabled devices that aren't secure, and end up as botnets that can be remote controlled and used for criminal purposes.

This should be prevented from happening in the first place, as much as possible, but we might not prevent everything, just becasue the world moves faster than we can catch up, and we might not know what to prevent before we've seen it happen. Therefore, when it does happen, it must be upon the manufactorer or reseller to fix the problem. If that's not possible, because the manufacturer is outside of our jurisdiction, or bankrupt, at least at that point ban the devices, and implement regulation to make sure it doesn't happen again.
